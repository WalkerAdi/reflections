How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It highlighted a section in which there was a difference so it was much faster 
	to compare the smaller sections

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Any mistakes or bugs that did not exist before could be easily spotted.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I know what I have changed since the last save and sometimes you want to be able to
	trial an edit before saving it, also you still have access to the previous versions

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    They were desined for different users and purposses, to most people having git track 
	multiple files is not nescessary 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can see which differences have taken place between different versions of the commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Always got something to fall back on!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Making android apps?
